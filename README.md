# The ultimate luck test
### TULT (The ultimate luck test) is an web-based project designed to showcase the concept of luck through the use of Random Number Generators (RNG)
### The main goal of this project is to provide users with an engaging and interactive platform that demonstrates how randomness can be perceived as luck, while also maintaining a competitive element through a leaderboard that tracks the luckiest participants.
